# Short description of the Study

Animals living with kin and nonkin should make social decisions based on the consequences for both direct and indirect fitness. Common vampire bats invest in stable cooperative relationships that benefit both components of inclusive fitness. To disentangle these two factors, the authors conducted two types of playback trials using a group of captive vampire bats with mixed kinship and varying rates of dyadic food sharing histories. Individuals were presented with two speakers in maze trials. Speakers played contact calls from different familiar conspecifics. In Experiment 1 (Past donor trials), 15 bats had to choose between between calls recorded from either a frequent or rare food donor, but both "callers" were related to a similar degree with the subject. In Experiment 2, 31 vampire bats had to choose between calls recorded from either a close or a distant relative, but both callers were matched for food-sharing history with the subject. The authors found that vampire bats were attracted to contact calls of frequent donors when controlling for kinship, but not to calls of kin when controlling for food sharing history. In addidion, respose and acoustic analysis suggest that bats recognized individuals from vocalizations. Together the results of the study corroborate prior observations in vampire bats that prior food sharing can overshadow relatedness in determining the social decisions of vampire bats. 

# Short description of the Methods (Playback experiment).
A subject bat was placed in a maze (see below) with five arms that allowed the subject to move forwards, backward, left, right or upwards. The bat was placed in the arm farthest from the camera, equidistant to the two speakers. After moving forward it could enter the arms to the left or right, wieh each option leading towards a speaker simultaneously playing calls from either a control bat or a test bat. The bat could also more straight backwards or forwards away from either speaker, or climb upwards, which bats typically do as an escape response. Those options allowed to remove cases where bats where not motivated. Each trial lasted 10 minutes. If the bat didn't make a choice in the first trial, the trial was discarded and a new trial began. Stimuli were presented on the left or right randomly. Maze was rotated 90 degree clockwise between each trial and the two trial types were presented on a random schedule to prevent order effects.

## Experiment 1 (Past donor)
Subject with a history of food sharing (N= 12 females, 3 males) was presented with choice between approaching contact calls from a frequent donor (test) and an infrequent donor or nondonor (control). Test and control bats differed in food donation rates but were matched by age and kinship. 

## Experiment 2 (Kinship)
Subject (N = 12 females, 19 males) was presented with a choice between contact calls from a close relative (test) and a distant or non-relative (control). Test and control bats differed in their pairwise kinship with the subject but they were closely matched wherever possible by age and past food sharing experience. 


In the following, I will mainly focus on the playback response analysis. The responses were measured by observers that were blind to the the playback treatments and design. The two response variables are differences between test and control (test-control). 

(1) Duration: Number of seconds that bats spend in either the control or the test arm. Response variables for analysis is therefore: Duration spend in test arm - Duration spend in control arm. If positive the bat spend more time in the test arm, if negative, the bat spend more time in the control arm.

(2) Latency: The latency in seconds from the start of the trial until the bat first entered either the control or the test arm. If the bat never entered the arm, latency was scored 600 s (10 min trials). Response variable for analysis is therefore: Latency to enter test arm - Latency to enter control arm. 

I will start with uploading the dataset provided by the authors and by installing and opening the required packages
```{r}
# required packages
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
install.packages("curl")
library(curl)
install.packages("boot")
library(boot)
install.packages("plyr")
library(plyr)
install.packages("broman")
library(broman)

# Upload the dataset
f<-curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BastiStockmaier/data-reanalysis-assignment/master/playback_response_data.csv")
dataset<-read.csv(f,header=TRUE, sep=",")
```

The response variables (duration, latency have long names) so I am going to change them using the "plyr" package.
```{r}
names(dataset)
dataset<-rename(dataset,c("entered.test..control"="latency", "test.control.time.in.arm..s."="duration"))
head(dataset)
```

Since there are two Experiments (past donor and kin) I will also split the dataset accordingly
```{r}
donors<-subset(dataset, trial.type=="donor")
head(donors)
kin<-subset(dataset,trial.type=="kin")
head(kin)
```
